1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Created an installation script to set up the environment on the remote server, including installing necessary libraries, Node.js, Newman, etc.
2. **Manual Process:**
   - Uploaded the installation script to the remote server using the SCP command.
   - Executed the script manually on the remote server to set up the environment.
3. **Automation Attempt:**
   - Developed a Python script to automate the entire process:
     a) Configured SSH authentication using a username and password.
     b) Automated the transfer of files from the local machine to the remote server.
     c) Executed the installation script remotely to install the required libraries and tools.


                              **SSH Tunnel Setup for Remote Access:**

**Step 1**
   -Connect to the remote server using SSH with dynamic port forwarding
   -ssh -D 5001 ssh emumba@192.168.0.70
   -The ‘-D’ will open up a tunnel with dynamic port forwarding

**Step 2: Convert SOCKS Proxy to HTTP Proxy**

1)Install http-proxy-to-socks package to covert socks proxy to http proxy
   *npm install -g http-proxy-to-socks*

2)Start the proxy conversion tool
   hpts -s 127.0.0.1:5001 -p 8080
   Now it will listen to http requests through 8080 and direct it to 5001 with the conversion

**Step 3: Configure Postman to Use the HTTP Proxy**
   1)Open Postman and go to Settings > Proxy.
   2)Enable the proxy by entering the following details:
   Proxy Server: 127.0.0.1:8080
